Module 4 challenge Writen Report

Summary of analysis:

-Each of the District school types have an Overall Passing % below 55%.
-Each of the Charter school types have an Overall Passing % above 89%.

-The math scores for every single school are lower than the reading scores of each school.
-The lower math scores for each of the District schools appear to be largely contributing to the lower Overall Passing % of the students.

-Each school's 9th-12th grade students appear to have very similar scores for the same school, so there is not a particular grade that heavily weighs on the math, reading, and overall passing scores.

-One potential cause of the Charter school's higher Overall Passing % could be due to the fact that these schools are all smaller in size, being under 2000 students, except for one school (Wilson High School). All of the District school's have over 2000 students with most of them very close to or surpassing 3000 students.

-It is interesting to see that the vast majority of the District schools have a higher budget per student than the Charter schools, yet have significantly lower overall passing percentages. These schools might need to revisit the distribution of their budget in order to help students improve their scores and increase the school's pverall passing percentage.
